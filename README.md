# MDD-diagnosis-GUI
## This graphical user interface lets the user diagnose MDD from EEG data in the form of (.edf) files.

1. First, install Anaconda or Python (**preferably Anaconda**).
2. Download all the files from here and extract them.
3. Open the Annaconda prompt ( or cmd if you installed raw python) in the extracted directory.
4. To install all the requirements, run the following command at the Anaconda prompt:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Then in the UI press ***Load*** button to load and plot the EEG raw file.
6. Press ***Diagnosis*** button to plot the **Gamma brainwave** of the EEG signal and diagnose MDD.
