# MDD-diagnosis-GUI
## This graphical user interface lets the user diagnose MDD from EEG data in the form of (.edf) files.

First, install Anaconda or Python (**preferably Anaconda**). Download all the files from here and extract them.
Open the Annaconda prompt in the extracted directory. *To install all the requirements, run the following command at the Anaconda prompt:*

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the requirements, you can run the **MDD_UI.py** file to open up the UI and use any eeg file for MDD diagnosis (try the provided EEG files).
